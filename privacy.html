                <p>At Klanto, we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information.
                  The purpose of

                  our
                  conversations with customers (the “Klanto Platform”). It explains how we use and disclose that
                  information, the choices you have regarding such use and disclosure, and how you may correct that
                  information. To

                <p>From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement is current as
                  of the
                  “last revised” date which appears at the top of this page. We will treat personal information in a
                  manner consistent with the Privacy Statement under which it was collected, unless we have your consent
                  to treat it
                  differently. This Privacy Statement applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from
                  any source.</p>
                <p>The Klanto Platform may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties.

                  third-party sites
