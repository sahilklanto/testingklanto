                                                recipients.</li>
                                            <li>We may decline to accept all or any part of a deposit at any time, for

                                                discretion. </li>
                                            <li>If you do not have enough money in your account to satisfy the amounts
                                                required for the transaction, including
                                                any related Transfer Fees, service fees or other charges, Klanto may
                                                charge you an administration fee.</li>
                                            <li>Klanto may refuse to accept your transaction, in its sole discretion.
                                                For example, Klanto may refuse to accept
                                                your transaction if Klanto is concerned that some or all of the funds
                                                originate from a counterfeit or
                                                illegitimate source. Klanto may ask for identification on a per
                                                transaction basis, but is not required to do so.
                                                Klanto may refuse to accept your funds or permit your transactions if
                                                you are unable to provide identification
                                                or if Klanto is not satisfied with the identification you provide.</li>
                                            <li>Klanto may cancel a transaction at any time prior to completion. Klanto
                                                may cancel a transaction if you and
                                                Klanto have any disagreement about the particulars, including without

                                                to the transaction. </li>

                                                you acknowledge and agree that the amounts of the transaction may not be
                                                recoverable and that you may still be
                                                charged certain fees relating to the transaction. </li>
                                            <li>If a transaction is sent to the wrong account, if a receiving financial

                                                acknowledge and agree that the amounts
                                                of the transaction may not be recoverable, you may still be charged
                                                certain fees relating to the transaction,
                                                and Klanto may not be able to tell you the reason for this issue.</li>
